## How to create a React and React Native project
üî† [Portugu√™s](README.pt-br.md)

This tutorial does not have a detailed instruction on React and React Native. The purpose is to bring together the step-by-step and commands to create a project, fast and simplified.

I suggest reading the documentation for any technology you are going to use. At first it may seem complicated, but only with the documentation that you really learn deeply about.

#### Content that can help you on this journey
* [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

### Table of Contents
1. [Web (front-end)](#web)
2. [Server (back-end)](#server)
3. [Mobile using React Native](#mobile)
4. [How to run](#run)
5. [Contribution or Issues](#contribution)

### What you need to get started:
First, you need to install these tools:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/);
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm);
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started);
* [Expo](https://expo.io/learn).

## Web (front-end) <a name="web"></a>
To create the web app you need to install the create-react-app. Use the following command in the terminal of your choice:
```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Access the folder where you want to create your project and run the following command:
```
create-react-app <project-name>
```
(the project-name without the `<>`)

My favorite code editor is Visual Studio Code, so to quickly open the folder I want to access, I access the folder through the terminal and use the command `code .` to open. Example:

![Example of how to open the folder via the command terminal](img/img-2.png)

The project structure will look like this:

![Project structure example](img/img-1.png)

I delete some files that I will not use:
* `App.css`
* `App.test.js`
* `index.css`
* `logo.svg`

The `servicerWorker.js` file is for working with PWA projects.


## Server (back-end) <a name="server"></a>
Access the folder where you want to create the server and run the following command:
```mkdir server```

Get into the folder `server` using the command `cd server` and use the yarn init command:
```yarn init -y```

Open the folder on Visual Studio Code using `code .`.

To complete the project configuration you need to install Typescript in the project. Use the following command:
```yarn add typescript -D```
and
```yarn tsc --init```

In the `tsconfig.json `file, change the `"target": "es5"` to `"target": "es2017"`. You need to do this because it is until the 2017 version that has the features that Node.js recognizes.

Use the following [command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node-dev) to run the server and see if there are any changes to the script. This automates the process to get Node to understand Typescript
```yarn add ts-node-dev -D```
The `-D` means that it will be used only in development mode and not in production.


## Mobile using React Native <a name="mobile"></a>
Use one of the following commands to create the mobile project:
```expo init mobile```
or
```expo init mobile --template "blank"```
